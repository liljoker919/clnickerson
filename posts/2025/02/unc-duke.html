            <h1>UNC vs. Duke: Breaking Down the Rivalry Battle on February 1, 2025</h1>

        <article class="content">


            <p>The heated rivalry between UNC and Duke delivered another classic battle on February 1, 2025. The game
                showcased dominant performances, key stats, and an overwhelming display of Duke’s offensive efficiency.
                While UNC fought hard, they struggled to keep up with Duke’s balanced attack and ability to get to the
                free-throw line. Let’s break down the numbers.</p>

            <p>UNC shot .536 eFG%, but their 18.5% turnover rate was costly, as Duke took advantage of every mistake.
                One of the biggest disparities was free throws—Duke attempted 11 more than UNC, leading to easy points.
            </p>

            <h2>UNC’s Key Players</h2>

            <p>RJ Davis – 12 points, leading the scoring effort.
                Seth Trimble – 10 points, showing some consistency on offense.
                >Drake Powell – 12 points off the bench, providing a needed spark.
                >UNC played solid team defense, but only having two players in double figures made it tough to compete
                against Duke’s depth.</p>

            <h2>Duke’s Dominance</h2>
            <p>Cooper Flagg – 20 points, asserting himself on both ends of the floor.</p>
            <p>Kon Knueppel – 21 points, hitting big shots and controlling the tempo.</p>
            <p>Duke had 4 players in double figures, showing why they are ranked No. 1 in the ACC and No. 2 in the AP
                Poll.</p>
            <h2>The Difference-Maker</h2>
            <p>One major takeaway from the game was Duke’s ability to get to the free-throw line. They shot 11 more free
                throws than UNC, a clear sign of how aggressive they were in attacking the basket.</p>

            <p>UNC is now 13-10 overall and sits 7th in the ACC, while Duke continues their dominant season at 19-2
                overall, 1st in the ACC, and 2nd in the AP Poll.</p>


            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>This game exposed some of UNC’s offensive struggles against elite teams. They’ll need to find more
                consistent scoring and limit turnovers if they want to improve their ACC standing. Meanwhile, Duke looks
                every bit the championship contender, with a deep roster and efficient scoring.</p>
