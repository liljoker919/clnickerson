            <h2>13 Years Running</h2>
            <p>For the past 13 years, my friends and I have made it a tradition to head to Las Vegas for the first
                weekend of the NCAA tournament. This year was no exception, and it delivered everything we hoped
                for—good food, great games, and unforgettable moments.</p>

            <h2>Sunday to Friday Schedule</h2>
            <p>We arrived on Sunday and stayed through Friday. Monday was St. Patrick’s Day, so we hit up Fremont Street
                for some festive fun and dinner at <strong>Whiskey Licker Up Saloon</strong>.</p>

            <p>Tuesday’s highlight was dinner at the legendary <strong>Herbs and Rye</strong>, known for their amazing
                steaks and cocktails.</p>

            <p>On Wednesday, we reserved recliners at <strong>Circa’s Sportsbook</strong>—the best seat in town to enjoy
                wall-to-wall tournament action.</p>

            <p>Thursday started with a hearty breakfast at <strong>Winnie & Ethel’s Downtown Diner</strong>. After that,
                we headed back to Circa for the free watch party, keeping the streak alive of watching nearly every game
                live.</p>

            <p>By Friday, we were worn out but determined to make the most of our last day. We bounced around a few
                casinos until our red-eye flight took us back home to the east coast.</p>

            <blockquote>
                “It’s not just about the games—it’s about the memories, the laughs, and the time together.”
            </blockquote>
